## Overview
This project aims to analyze a Zomato dataset using Structured Query Language (SQL) to derive meaningful insights into restaurant listings, customer preferences, and market trends. The dataset typically includes information such as restaurant names, cuisines, locations, ratings, cost for two, delivery options, and more.

The project’s main goal is to apply SQL queries to explore and interpret this data, answering critical questions relevant to restaurant discovery, customer behavior, and business strategy. Key areas of analysis include:

* Identifying the distribution of restaurant types and cuisines across various cities

* Analyzing average ratings to determine quality standards in different locations

* Studying pricing patterns to understand cost segments among restaurants

* Evaluating the prevalence of online ordering and table booking facilities

* Finding top-rated or most popular restaurants in a given area

* Understanding the impact of location on restaurant performance and customer choice

## Obejctive
The primary objective of this project is to leverage SQL to analyze Zomato’s restaurant dataset and extract actionable insights related to dining trends, customer preferences, and restaurant performance. By systematically querying and interpreting the data, the project aims to:

* Identify key patterns in cuisine popularity and restaurant types

* Analyze restaurant ratings and reviews to assess quality benchmarks

* Understand pricing segments and cost distributions across locations

* Evaluate the availability and impact of services like online ordering and table booking

* Highlight top-performing restaurants based on ratings and customer engagement

* Support data-driven decision-making for restaurant owners, food delivery services, and marketing strategists

  ## Conclusion
  Through systematic SQL-based analysis of the Zomato dataset, this project successfully uncovered valuable insights into restaurant performance, customer preferences, and dining patterns across various locations. The findings revealed the most popular cuisines, price ranges, and the role of facilities such as online ordering and table booking in shaping customer choices.
Overall, the project demonstrates how SQL can be effectively used to process, query, and interpret real-world data, supporting informed business decisions for restaurant owners, food delivery platforms, and market researchers. It also strengthened skills in relational data management and data-driven storytelling, laying the groundwork for more advanced analytics or predictive modeling in the future.
Overall, the project intends to strengthen data analytics skills using SQL while providing meaningful conclusions that can guide better business strategies in the food and hospitality sector.
